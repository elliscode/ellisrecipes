# Pork Ribs Sous Vide
## Ingredients
- 2 whole racks St. Louis-cut pork ribs
- Barbecue sauce
### For The Spice Rub:
- 1/3 cup paprika
- 1/3 cup dark brown sugar
- 1/4 cup kosher salt
- 1 tsp Prague Powder #1 (optional; see note)
- 2 TBSP whole yellow mustard seed
- 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper
- 2 TBSP granulated garlic powder
- 1 TBSP dried oregano
- 1 TBSP whole coriander seed
- 1 tsp red pepper flakes
## Directions
- For the Spice Rub: Working in batches, combine the paprika, brown sugar, salt, Prague Powder (if using), mustard seed, black pepper, garlic powder, oregano, coriander seed, and red pepper flakes in a spice grinder and reduce to a fine powder.
- For the Sauce (if using): Combine 3 TBSP spice rub, grated onion, ketchup, mustard, molasses, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, and liquid smoke in a medium saucepan and whisk to combine. Bring to a bare simmer and cook until reduced and thickened, about 20 minutes. Set aside.
- Prepare the Ribs: Remove the papery membrane on the back of the ribs, using a paper towel or kitchen towel to grip it and pulling it away in one piece. Divide each rack of ribs into three to four portions, with three to four ribs per portion, by cutting through the meat in between the ribs. Rub ribs generously on all sides with the remaining spice rub mixture. (Set aside 3 TBSP spice rub if making dry-style ribs.)
- Place individual portions of rubbed ribs in vacuum bags. (Fold over the top of each bag while you add the ribs so that no rub or pork juices get on the edges of the bags, which can weaken the seal.) Add 4 drops (about 1/8 tsp) liquid smoke to each bag. Seal the bags, transfer to refrigerator, and let rest for 4 to 12 hours.
- When Ready to Cook: Set your precision cooker to 145F (63C) for extra-meaty ribs or 165F (74C) for more traditionally textured ribs.
- Add ribs to the water bath and cover it with a lid, aluminum foil, or table tennis balls. Cook for 36 hours at 145F or 12 hours at 165F. Transfer cooked ribs to a large bowl of water filled with ice to chill thoroughly. Ribs can be stored in the refrigerator at this stage for up to 5 days before finishing.
- To Finish Sauced Ribs in the Oven: Remove ribs from vacuum bags and carefully pat dry with paper towels. Adjust oven racks to upper and lower-middle positions and preheat oven to 300F (150C). Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with aluminum foil and place a wire rack in each. Divide ribs evenly on racks, meat-side up. Transfer ribs to oven and cook until surface is sizzling and ribs are heated through, about 20 minutes. Brush ribs with sauce and return to oven for 10 minutes. Remove from oven, brush with another layer of sauce, and return to oven until sauce is dried and sticky, about 10 minutes longer. Remove ribs from oven, paint with one last layer of sauce, and serve, passing extra sauce at the table.
