# Mashed Potatoes
## Ingredients
- 5 lbs Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut lengthwise into quarters
- 2 tsp salt
- 200 g heavy cream
- 100 g butter
- 60 g milk
## Directions
### Cook The Potatoes
- Place the peeled and cut potatoes into a medium saucepan.
- Add cold water to the pan until the potatoes are covered by at least an inch. Add a half tsp of salt to the water.
- Turn the heat to high and bring the water to a boil. Reduce the heat to low to maintain a simmer, and cover.
- Cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until you can easily poke through the potatoes with a fork.
### Drain And Mash The Potatoes:
- When the potatoes are done, drain the water and place the steaming hot potatoes into a large bowl. Pour the heated cream and melted butter over the potatoes.
- Mash the potatoes with a potato masher. Then use a strong wooden spoon to beat further.
- Add milk and beat until the mashed potatoes are smooth. Don't over-beat the potatoes or the mashed potatoes will end up gluey.
- Add salt and pepper to taste.
