# Focaccia

## INGREDIENTS
- 472 g all-purpose flour
- 39 g vital wheat gluten
- 8 g instant yeast
- 10 g kosher salt
- 455 g 110F water
- olive oil

## INSTRUCTIONS
- combine flour, gluten, and yeast in a large bowl and whisk to combine
- add water and mix with rubber spatula until dough ball forms
- coat in a small amount of olive oil, then cover and refrigerate overnight
- the next day, grease two pie pans with Butter
- pour a TBSP of olive oil in the center of each pan
- Using two forks, deflate the dough by releasing it from the sides of the bowl and pulling it toward the center. Rotate the bowl in quarter turns as you deflate, turning the mass into a rough ball. Use the forks to split the dough into two equal pieces. Place one piece into one of the prepared pans. Roll the dough ball in the oil to coat it all over, forming a rough ball. Repeat with the remaining piece. Let the dough balls rest for 3 to 4 hours depending on the temperature of your kitchen.
- preheat oven to 425F
- Pour another TBSP of oil over each round of dough. Rub your hands lightly in the oil to coat, then, using all of your fingers, press straight down to create deep dimples. If necessary, gently stretch the dough as you dimple to allow the dough to fill the pan. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt all over.
- Transfer the pans to the oven and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the underside is golden and crisp. Remove the pans from the oven and transfer the focaccia to cooling racks. Let it cool for 10 minutes before cutting and serving; let it cool completely if you are halving it with the intention of making a sandwich.
