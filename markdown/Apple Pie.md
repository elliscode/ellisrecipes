# Apple Pie

## Ingredients
- Top and bottom pie crust
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter
- 3 TBSP all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/2 cup white sugar
- 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
- 3 granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced

## Directions
- Preheat oven to 425F. Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.
- Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.
- Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350F. Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
