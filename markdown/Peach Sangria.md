# Peach Sangria

## Ingredients

- `1` cup (`8` oz) Absolut APeach Vodka
- `1` cup (`8` oz) Patron Citronge - Extra Fine Orange Liqueur
- `1` (`750` ml) Bottle White Zinfandel (we used Beringer)
- `2` cups (`16` oz) Cranberry Juice (we used Simply Cranberry Cocktail) - Keep Cold
- `1` cup (`8` oz) Orange Juice (we used Simply Orange) - Keep Cold
- `1` cup (`8` oz) Simple Syrup (we used Keep it Simple Syrup)
- If you want it less sweet, try using `1/2` cup or `4` oz of the syrup.
- Garnish with Sliced Fresh Lemons and Strawberries
- We used `1` lemon and 5 large strawberries for the batch. Feel free to add more strawberries.

## Directions

- Separately, slice up the lemon and strawberries and set aside.
- Mix all other ingredients together in a pitcher, except the ice.
- We typically fill the glasses with ice and add several strawberries and a slice of lemon (or 2 cut in half) and then fill with the sangria drink mixture. We add the ice separately so as not to dilute the sangria mixture if the pitcher will sit for a bit.
- You can also mix it altogether and serve.
