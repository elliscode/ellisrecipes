# Vegan Chocolate Cupcakes

## Ingredients

- 240 g plant milk
- 1 tsp vinegar
- 150 g sugar
- 71 g vegetable oil
- 1.5 tsp vanilla extract
- 120 g flour
- 28 g cocoa powder
- 3/4 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp salt

## Directions

- Preheat the oven to 350 and prepare a dozen muffin cups - either outfit a muffin pan with paper or foil liners, or use a baking sheet and set out 12 paper liners nested inside foil liners, or else use silicone muffin cups.
- In a large mixing bowl, stir together the soy or rice milk, vinegar, sugar, vegetable oil and vanilla extract.
- In another bowl, stir together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Sift the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, pausing two or three times to stir, and keep stirring until all the large lumps are gone.
- Pour the batter into the cupcake liners until they are about two-thirds full. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
- When cool, frost however you like
