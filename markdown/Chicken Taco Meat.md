# Chicken Taco Meat

## Equipment

- Dutch Oven

## Ingredients

- 1.5-2 lb. boneless, skinless chicken thighs (see notes for breasts)
- 2 TBSP extra-virgin olive oil plus more for skillet, if needed
- 1 TBSP smoked paprika
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- juice and zest of one lime
- lime wedges and fresh cilantro for serving, optional

## Instructions

- Mix the olive oil (2 TBSP), smoked paprika (1 TBSP), ground coriander (1 tsp), ground cumin (1 tsp), garlic powder (1 tsp), kosher salt (1 tsp), black pepper (1/2 tsp), and lime juice and zest (from one lime) in a small bowl or glass measuring cup.
- Place the chicken thighs in a container, bowl, or large plastic bag. Pour the marinade on top (it will be thick) and or stir to coat each piece of chicken evenly (if in a bag, just smoosh it around until everything is evenly coated). Cover and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes, or as long as 24 hours.
- Heat a large (12-inch) non-stick skillet over medium high heat (see notes for other skillets). Add marinated chicken; sear without moving on one side for 5-7 minutes (check that it's not burning after 2-3 minutes- you may want to turn the heat down to medium if you have very hot burners or flip it earlier if it's cooking fast).
- Once the seared side is browned and looking crispy, flip to other side and sear, until chicken is cooked through to 165 degrees F or meat is no longer pink (another 5-10 minutes, depending on thickness and size of chicken. Turn the heat down to medium or medium-low if both sides are seared but inside is not yet cooked the whole way). If you have a lid to your skillet, you can cover it to speed up the cooking time a bit.
- Remove chicken from skillet to a cutting board. Allow to rest for 5 minutes, then shred with two forks. Optional: for an extra punch of flavor, you can return the shredded chicken to the skillet to coat in the cooking juices.
- Serve with a squeeze of fresh lime juice garnished with fresh cilantro, if desired. Use in enchiladas, on tacos or burritos, in bowls, or on its own as a main course.
