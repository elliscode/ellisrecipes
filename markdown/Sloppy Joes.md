# Sloppy Joes

## Ingredients

- `1` small onion, finely chopped
- `1/2` small green bell pepper, seeded and finely diced
- `1` Tbsp worcestershire sauce
- `1` tsp yellow mustard
- `1` Tbsp brown sugar
- `15` oz can tomato sauce
- `1` lb lean ground beef, 85%-90% lean
- `1` Tbsp olive oil
- `1/2` tsp salt, or to taste
- `1/4` tsp ground black pepper, or to taste
- `3` garlic cloves, minced
- `1/4` cup water, optional, or added to desired consistency
- `4` hamburger buns, toasted if desired

## Instructions

- Finely chop the onion. Seed and finely dice the green pepper.

- In a bowl, combine the Worcestershire sauce, mustard, brown sugar, and tomato sauce.

- Place a large skillet or dutch oven over medium/high heat. Add olive oil and ground beef. Saute the beef for about 5 minutes until cooked through and no longer pink, breaking it up with a spatula. Season with salt and pepper and add in the diced peppers and onion. Cook another 5 minutes until the veggies are tender and beef is browned.

- Add the minced garlic and saute 30 seconds until fragrant, stirring constantly. Add in the sauce and bring to a light boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered for about 10-15 minutes or until thickened to your liking. Season to taste with salt and pepper and add water if you prefer a looser consistency. Serve on toasted buns for Sloppy Joe Sandwiches.
