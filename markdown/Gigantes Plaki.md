# Gigantes Plaki
## Ingredients
- 500 g gigantes beans (17 oz)
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 1 small clove of garlic
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 4-5 TBSP parsley, finely chopped
- 1/2 TBSP celery, finely chopped
- 1/2 cup of hot water
- 400 g (14 oz) tinned chopped tomatoes or 600 g (21 oz) ripped fresh tomatoes, grated
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
## Directions
- For an easier alternative, after soaking the gigantes beans overnight, drain and rinse them. Place in a large pan with enough water to cover them and bring to the boil. Boil for 5 minutes, drain them and place into a large baking pan, along with all of the ingredients, cover with some aluminum foil and bake at 180C for approx. 2 hours. The last 30 minutes, bake without the aluminium foil. Enjoy!
