# Candied Pecans
## Ingredients
- 6 TBSP brown sugar
- 1.5 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp fine sea salt, see notes
- Pinch cayenne pepper, optional
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1.5 TBSP water
- 2 tsp orange zest, optional
- 6 oz pecan halves
## DIRECTIONS
- Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
- Add brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, cayenne, vanilla, water, and the orange zest (optional) to a medium skillet.
- Place the skillet over medium heat and cook, stirring often until the brown sugar melts into a bubbling sauce, about 1 minute.
- Stir in the pecans so that the brown sugar sauce coats them.
- Cook, stirring the entire time, until the pecans look candied and smell nutty, 2 to 3 minutes.
- As the nuts heat up in the pan, the sauce will slowly coat them and become shiny. Watch closely as the nuts cook so that they do not burn.
- Transfer the candied pecans to the prepared baking sheet and spread into one layer.
- Allow the pecans to cool down, and then break them up before serving.
- Store cooled candied nuts in an airtight container. They will last at room temperature for one week, in the refrigerator for a few weeks and in the freezer for a month, if not longer.
