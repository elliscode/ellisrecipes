# Masoor Dal Tadka

## Ingredients

- `2` cups dry masoor dal (aka red lentils), sorted and well rinsed
- `6` cups water
- `1` TBSP oil (coconut oil or neutral flavored)
- `1` large yellow onion, finely diced
- `1/2` tsp garlic powder
- `1/2` tsp ground ginger
- `2` green chiles, minced (optional)
- `1` TBSP Indian curry powder
- `1/4` tsp mustard seed
- `1` tsp ground coriander
- `1/2` tsp ground cumin
- `1.5` tsp salt, more to taste
- `15` oz can diced tomatoes, or `1.5` cups chopped fresh tomatoes

## Instructions

- Combine the lentils and water in a large pot. Bring to a boil, then turn the heat down to simmer. Skim off any foam that collects on top. Cook, partially covered, until the lentils are tender, usually 15-20 minutes.
- While the lentils are cooking, make the tadka. Heat a skillet over medium heat and add the oil and onion, garlic, ginger, chiles, and a pinch of salt. Fry until soft, about 5 minutes.
- Add the spices: curry powder, mustard, coriander, and cumin, along with the salt. Stir to combine and cook for about 60 seconds, then add the tomatoes. Cook about 7 minutes to cook down the tomatoes if canned, or until the tomatoes are soft and saucy if fresh.
- Add the tadka to the cooked lentils, and simmer over low heat for about 5 minutes to infuse with flavor.
- Serve garnished with cilantro and with basmati rice.
- Notes
- Cook time can vary for lentils depending on how fresh they are. Very fresh lentils take less time to cook, whereas if they've been sitting around for a couple of years they may take longer.
