# Peruvian Chicken

## Ingredients

- `4` boneless, skinless chicken breast(s) or 8 boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- `1` TBSP oil
- `1` TBSP cumin seeds
- `6` cloves garlic, peeled
- `1` onion(s), chopped
- `1/2` jalapeno pepper, seeded
- `1` cup chicken broth
- `1` tsp smoked paprika (dulce)
- `1` tsp oregano, dried
- `1` tsp cumin, ground
- `1` tsp sugar
- `1` TBSP lime
- `1` orange pepper, chopped or 1 red pepper(s), chopped
- `1/2` cup mint, fresh, chopped or `1/2` cup cilantro, fresh, chopped

## Directions

- Trim any fat from chicken. Heat oil in a wide frying pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and stir frequently until they start to brown, about 3 minutes. Push to the side of the pan. Add chicken and cook until golden tinged, about 3 minutes a side.
- Meanwhile chop the garlic and onion. Finely chop the jalapeno and add all after removing chicken from the pan. Stir often for 3 minutes, then add broth. Return chicken to the pan and sprinkle with paprika, oregano, cumin and sugar. Grate lime peel over top. Slice lime in half and squeeze the juice over all. Stir in the pepper and turn the chicken.
- Cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer 15 minutes. Turn chicken and stir vegetables. Continue simmering, uncovered, until chicken feels springy when pressed, about 15 more minutes or until internal temperature reaches 165F (74C). Stir in half the mint. Serve over rice and sprinkle with remaining mint. Covered and refrigerated, leftovers will keep well at least 2 days.
