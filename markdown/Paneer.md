# Paneer

## Ingredients
- 1.5 liters full fat milk (6 cups) (48 oz)
- 2 TBSP white wine vinegar
- 1/2 tsp salt

### Equpiment Needed
- colander (strainer)
- cheese cloth (muslin cloth or fresh handkerchief)
- tofu press

## INSTRUCTIONS

### Preparation
- Pour milk to a heavy bottom pot & bring it to a gentle boil on a medium heat. Keep stirring occasionally to ensure the milk doesn't get scorched at the bottom.
- Meanwhile place a colander over a large bowl to collect the whey. Spread a cheese cloth over the colander.

How to make paneer
- When the milk comes to a boil, turn off the stove and pour 2 TBSP of vinegar.
- Stir it well for 1 to 2 mins until the entire milk curdles completely. (milk solids begin to separate from the whey). When done correctly whey will be not be milky any more but will be clear.
- Troubleshooting: If you see the milk doesn't curdle fully, then add 1 TBSP vinegar and turn ON the stove. Boil the milk on a medium heat until the whole pot of milk curdles. Turn off as soon as you see it curdles. If you continue to cook at this stage, paneer can become hard.
- Gently pour the entire paneer along with whey to the colander. Pour some cold water to stop the paneer from cooking further.
- Rinse it under running water to remove the smell & taste of the vinegar.

### How To Set Paneer
- Wring the cheese cloth making a round shape of the paneer. Squeeze any excess whey or water. Make a knot and hang the paneer for 30 mins so the excess whey drains.
- Remove the knot and twist the edges of the cloth. Place the cheese cloth along with the paneer on a flat colander or a wooden board. Press down the cloth & place a heavy object on it for the paneer to set. (check the video below)
- I usually put a pot or cast iron pan over the paneer and then place a 2 to 3 kg rice pack.
- After 3 to 4 hours, remove the cloth and cut the paneer to cubes.
- Refrigerate the homemade paneer and use up with 2 to 3 weeks. Or freeze up to 3 months.
- Avoid overcooking the paneer after adding it to the curry. It does not need much cooking. I generally add it to the gravy and turn off the stove. Keep the pan covered so the paneer absorbs the flavors.
