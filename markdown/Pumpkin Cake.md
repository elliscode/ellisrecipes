# Pumpkin Cake

## Ingredients

- 2 cups (250 g) all-purpose flour (spoon & leveled)
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 and 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice*
- 1 cup (240 ml) canola or vegetable oil*
- 4 large eggs
- 1 cup (200 g) packed light or dark brown sugar
- 1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar
- 1 (15 oz) can pumpkin puree*
- 1 and 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract

### Cream Cheese Frosting

- 8 oz (224 g) full-fat block cream cheese, softened to room temperature
- 1/2 cup (115 g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
- 3 cups (360 g) confectioners sugar, plus an extra 1/4 cup if needed
- 1 tsp pure vanilla extract
- 1/8 tsp salt

## Instructions

- Preheat the oven to 350F (177C) and grease a x3 inch baking pan. I always use this glass pan.
- Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice together in a large bowl. Set aside. Whisk the oil, eggs, brown sugar, granulated sugar, pumpkin, and vanilla extract together until combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and use a mixer or whisk until completely combined. Batter will be thick.
- Spread batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 30-36 minutes. Baking times vary, so keep an eye on yours. The cake is done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. If you find the top or edges of the cake is/are browning too quickly in the oven, loosely cover it with aluminum foil.
- Remove the cake from the oven and set the entire pan on a wire rack. Allow to cool completely. After about 45 minutes, I usually place the cake in the refrigerator to speed things up.

### Make The Frosting

- In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese and butter together on high speed until smooth and creamy. Add 3 cups confectioners sugar, vanilla, and salt. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then switch to high speed and beat for 2 minutes. If you want the frosting a little thicker, add the extra 1/4 cup of confectioners sugar (I add it). Spread the frosting on the cooled cake. Refrigerate for 30 minutes before serving. This helps sets the frosting and makes cutting easier.
- Cover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for 5 days.
