# Vegan Chocolate Cake

## Ingredients

- 1.5 cup unsweetened almond milk
- 1.5 TBSP apple cider vinegar
- 3 cups all purpose flour
- 2.625 cups granulated sugar
- 1.125 cup cocoa powder
- 3 tsp baking powder
- 2.25 tsp baking soda
- 1.5 tsp salt
- 3/4 cup canola oil
- 1 cup unsweetened applesauce
- 1.5 TBSP pure vanilla extract
- 1.5 cup boiling water

## Instructions

- Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and grease two 9-inch cake pans. I also line them with parchment rounds and lightly flour for easy removal of the cakes later.
- Measure 1.5 cup unsweetened almond milk and add the TBSP of vinegar to it. Stir slightly and set aside to curdle.
- In a large bowl, add the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Whisk well to combine.
- Now add the oil, applesauce, vanilla and almond milk/vinegar mixture. Mix on medium speed with a hand mixer (or stand mixer with the paddle attachment) until well combined.
- Lower the speed and carefully pour in the boiling water, continuing to mix into the cake batter until combined. The batter will seem very runny at this point; that is how it should be, trust me!
- Divide the batter evenly between your cake pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. After 10 minutes of cooling in the pan, carefully remove the cakes from the pans and let cool completely before frosting.
