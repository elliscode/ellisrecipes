# Triple Berry Pie
## Notes
Buy 18 oz of each type of berry
## Ingredients
- 7 cups fresh or frozen raspberries, blueberries and blackberries about 2.3333 cups of each type of berry*
- 1 cup granulated sugar (plus a little extra to sprinkle on top of the pie)
- 1 TBSP lemon juice
- 4 TBSP cornstarch
- 2 TBSP butter
- 1 large egg white beaten with a fork
## Instructions
- Cook berries: Add berries, sugar and lemon juice to a large saucepan over medium heat.
- Simmer, until warm and juicy, about 5-10 minutes, gently stirring occasionally. (You can taste it at this point and see if it's sweet enough for your liking. I don't like to make mine too sweet, but if you want it sweeter you can add 1/4 cup more sugar.)
- Thicken filling: Spoon out about 1/2 cup of the juice from the pan into a bowl. Stir cornstarch into the juice until smooth.
- Bring pot of berries back to a simmer and slowly pour in the cornstarch. Gently stir mixture (being careful not to mash the berries), until thickened, about 2-5 minutes.
- Cool and add to pie shell. Remove from heat and stir in the butter. Allow to cool for 15 minutes. Pour mixture into unbaked pie shell (in a 9 in deep dish pan).
- Add lattice top or a whole top with holes pricked on top for steam to escape. (See directions for lattice crust below).
- Pinch the edges of the top and bottom pie crusts together and crimp the edge, if you like. Brush a thin layer of beaten egg white over the top of the pie and sprinkle lightly with sugar.
