# Cherry Pie Filling

## Ingredients

- 5 to 6 cups fresh pitted cherries, about 2.5 to 3 pounds
- 1/2 cup water
- 2 TBSP freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 2/3 cup granulated sugar
- 4 TBSP cornstarch
- 1/4 tsp almond extract, optional

## Instructions

- In a saucepan over medium heat, combine cherries, water, lemon juice, sugar and cornstarch.
- Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and cook, stirring frequently, for about 10 minutes.
- If using, stir in almond extract. Cool slightly before using as a topping.

## Notes

- If using sour cherries, you will need to adjust the amount of sugar. I'd recommend starting about cup and working your way up if more sweetness is needed.
- Refrigerate leftover fresh cherry pie filling in a sealed container for up to 3 days.
- This recipe freezes beautifully.
