# Arakas Latheros

## Ingredients
- 1 pound peas (fresh or frozen)
- 1 onion diced
- 2 carrots sliced
- 1 potato cut in bite size pieces
- 2 medium grated tomatoes or 14 oz canned chopped tomatoes
- 1/3 cup olive oil
- 1 tsp chopped dill
- 1/2 tsp salt/pepper
- 7 oz water

## Instructions
- Heat olive oil in a medium sized pot.
- Saute onions until soft. Add carrots and potatoes and saute 3-4 minutes more.
- Add peas and heat and mix until all peas are covered in the olive oil.
- Add the tomato, dill, pepper and a half tsp salt. Add enough hot water so that the peas are covered just a bit (about 1/4 cup).
- Mix well and bring to a boil. Then lower heat and simmer for 30 minutes, until peas are soft and water is gone-they should only be left with the olive oil.
- Serve at room temperature with feta and bread. Add salt as needed.
