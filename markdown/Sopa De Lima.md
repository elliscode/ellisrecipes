# Sopa De Lima

## Ingredients

- `1` large onion
- `1` sweet red pepper
- `4` garlic cloves
- `3` spring onions
- `6` limes
- `2` tomatoes
- `6` chicken thighs (deboned)
- `1` red or habanero chilli
- `1` tsp oregano
- `1/2` tsp ground cinnamon
- `1/2` tsp thyme
- `1` litre chicken stock

## Directions

- Dice the onion and red pepper, and cook in some olive oil on a medium heat until they soften. Chop the spring onions into discs and add them as the onion and red pepper begin to soften.
- Slice the garlic and dice the tomatoes. Add them to the pan, along with the cinnamon, oregano and thyme. You can also add the chopped red or habanero chilli here, removing the seeds if you arent too keen on heat.
- Cook this all until it begins to break down.
- Take the bones out of the chicken thighs and remove the skin.
- Add them, whole, to the pan and cook until they are seared on the outside.
- Add the chicken stock and simmer until the chicken is completely cooked.
- Remove the chicken thighs from the broth and shred as much as possible.
- Add the shredded chicken back into the stock along with the juice of 5 limes. Add the peels of one of the juiced limes into the stock as well, but not all 5.
- Simmer and season to taste.
- Whilst this is cooking, heat an inch of oil in a pan. Cut the flour tortillas into strips and fry until they brown.
- Remove from the oil and let cool until they are crunchy and crisp.
- Serve the soup and garnish with the fried tortilla strips, sour cream, avocado and coriander. Feel free to add some more fresh chilli here if youre feeling wild.
