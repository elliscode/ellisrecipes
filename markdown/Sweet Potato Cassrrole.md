# Sweet Potato Cassrrole
## Ingredients
### Sweet Potatoes:
- 2.5 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed
- salt
- 2 TBSP butter
- 2 large eggs
- 1/4 cup maple syrup
- 1/4 cup buttermilk
- 1/3 cup milk
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 pinch ground allspice
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper
### Pistachio Crust:
- 1/2 cup chopped roasted, salted pistachios
- 1/2 cup light brown sugar
- 1/3 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup butter, melted
## Directions
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 2 1/2-quart baking dish with butter.
- Step 2 Place sweet potato cubes into a large pot, cover with water, and add a large pinch of salt. Bring to a boil and cook until a knife is easily inserted into a sweet potato cube, about 10 minutes. Drain well. Return to the pot and mash 2 TBSP butter into sweet potatoes.
- Step 3 Whisk eggs, maple syrup, buttermilk, milk, vanilla extract, cayenne pepper, allspice, and 1/2 tsp salt together in a large bowl until smooth. Gradually mash sweet potatoes into egg mixture, starting with 2 TBSP of sweet potato mixture, until all sweet potatoes are incorporated. Transfer sweet potatoes into prepared baking dish.
- Step 4 Mix pistachios, brown sugar, flour, and 1/4 cup melted butter together until completely mixed. Crumble topping evenly over top of sweet potatoes. Use the back of a fork to gently press pistachio mixture down onto sweet potatoes.
- Step 5 Bake in the preheated oven until topping is browned and casserole is set, 25 to 30 minutes. If desired, place under oven's broiler for 5 minutes to give topping a little more brown color. Let rest to cool slightly before serving, about 10 minutes.
