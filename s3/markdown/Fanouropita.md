## Ingredients

- `1` cup seed oil
- `1` cup granulated sugar
- `1` cup orange juice
- `1` tsp baking soda
- `1` tsp ground cinammon
- `1/2` tsp grond clove
- `3` cups self-rising flour
- `80` g (`3` oz.) raisins
- `80` g (`3` oz.) chopped walnuts


## Directions

- preheat the oven to 350F
- add in a large bowl the sugar and vegetable oil. Using a hand whisk beat until the sugar dissolves.
- in a separate bowl, combine the orange juice with the baking soda and mix with a fork until the baking soda froths and dissolves completely.
- add the orange juice and baking soda mixture to the bowl with the sugar and oil. Whisk thoroughly using a hand whisk or an electric mixer.
- in another bowl add the flour, ground cinnamon, ground clove, raisins and chopped walnuts. Mix using a wooden spoon.
- add the flour mixture to the liquid mixture, a little bit at a time, whilst whisking. Mix until the ingredients are completely combined and the mixture is smooth like a thick batter.
- transfer the mixture for the fanouropita to a round oiled baking pan 28cm in diameter and bake for 45-60 minutes, depending on the oven. To check if the fanouropita is ready stick a toothpich in the cake. If the toothpick comes out clean then it is ready. If not bake a little longer and check again.
- leave the fanouropita to cool down completely before removing the pan. Serve the fanouropita with icing sugar.
