## Directions

- Drizzle the chicken with 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil and sprinkle on the garam masala, curry powder, salt and pepper. Massage into the meat and cover, leaving to marinate for at least 2 hours or overnight. Instead of a bowl, use a 1 gallon zip top bag to marinate the chicken for a more even distribution of the marinade and easier clean up.
- Heat a cast iron or grill pan over medium-high heat.
- Cook the chicken for 5-6 minutes per side, until cooked to an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees F. Remove to a cutting board and cover with foil, allowing it to rest while you make the sauce.
- Meanwhile, make the korma sauce. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok set over medium heat. When hot, add onions and 1/4 cup water. Saute until onions are golden brown, 12-15 minutes. Stir in the ground almonds and garlic and cook for 1 minute. Transfer mixture to the bowl of a blender. Add yogurt and remaining water; puree until smooth.
- Measure out the spices (curry powder through nutmeg) into a small bowl.
- In the same skillet or wok, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil over medium heat. Once the oil is shimmering, add the spices and toast for 1 minute, then stir in the onion-yogurt puree. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly, until it begins to darken in color.
- Add the tomatoes, coconut milk, red chili, ginger, and brown sugar. Stir well.
- Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes at least, stirring occasionally to avoid scorching.
- Cut the cooked chicken into bite-sized pieces and add to the pan. Stir in the chicken well. 
- Simmer for an additional 15 minutes.
- Serve with steamed basmati rice and/or naan.
- Optionally garnish with chopped chives
