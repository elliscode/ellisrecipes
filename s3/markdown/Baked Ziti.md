# Baked Ziti

## Ingredients

- `1` pound ziti or penne pasta
- Kosher salt
- `1` tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
- `1` pound bulk Italian sausage, ground beef, or ground pork
- `1` large onion, chopped
- `3` to `4` cloves garlic, chopped
- `1` tablespoon minced fresh rosemary or basil
- `1` tablespoon Italian seasoning
- `1/2` teaspoon red pepper flakes
- `4` cups jarred marinara or pasta sauce, or make your own tomato sauce
- Black pepper, to taste
- `8` ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded
- `1` cup grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese
- `1` heaping cup ricotta cheese

## Instructions


- Preheat the oven to 350F.
- Heat a large pot of salted water (for every 2 quarts of water, one tablespoon of salt) to a strong boil. Add the pasta and cook at a rolling boil, uncovered, until the pasta is al dente.
- Drain the pasta through a colander. Toss with a little olive oil so the pasta does not stick together while you make the sauce.
- While the water is heating in the previous step, start on the sauce. Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a large saut pan on medium-high heat. When the oil is shimmering hot, add the bulk sausage or ground meat. Break up any large chunks of sausage as it cooks. Brown well.
- Don't stir that often or it will be more difficult for the meat to brown. If you are using ground beef or pork instead of sausage, sprinkle with a little salt.
- When the meat is mostly browned, add the onions and stir well to combine. Saut everything until the onions are translucent and beginning to brown.
- Add the garlic, rosemary or basil, Italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes and stir to combine. Cook 1 minute, then add the tomato sauce and stir well. Bring to a simmer.
- Spread a thin layer of the sauce in the bottom of a casserole pan, then dot the surface with half the ricotta cheese. Ladle a spoonful of sauce into the pasta, stir it well and then add the pasta into the casserole.
- Pour the rest of the sauce over the pasta, dot the remaining ricotta cheese over the pasta, and sprinkle on top both the mozzarella and the Parmesan cheese.
- Bake uncovered in the oven at 350F until the top is lightly browned and the cheese melted, about 20 to 25 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
