# Zucchini Quiche
## Ingredients

### Filling 
`3` tablespoons butter
`4` cups thinly sliced zucchini (about 3 medium)
`1` large onion, thinly sliced
`2` large eggs, room temperature (this seems too little)
`2` teaspoons dried parsley flakes
`1/2` teaspoon salt
`1/2` teaspoon garlic powder
`1/2` teaspoon dried basil
`1/2` teaspoon dried oregano
`1/4` teaspoon pepper
`2` cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
`2` teaspoons prepared mustard

## Directions

- preheat the oven to 400F
- cook the zucchini and onion in `1` tsp butter on low, the goal here is to remove as much moisture from them as possible, so low and slow for about 30 minutes would work
- whisk together the eggs and spices until beaten thorougly
- add everything except the mustart to a large bowl and mix thoroughly
- spread the mustard on the bottom of the prepared pie crust, then pour in the mixture
- bake for 40 minutes
