# Zucchini Quiche

## Ingredients

### Cooked vegetables

- `1` tablespoons butter
- `4` cups thinly sliced zucchini (about 3 medium)
- `1` large onion, thinly sliced

### Filling

- The cooked vegetable mix from the previous step
- `4` large eggs, room temperature (this seems too little)

- `1/2` teaspoon dried oregano
- `1/4` teaspoon pepper
- `2` cups (`228` g) low moisture mozzarella
- `2` tablespoons melted butter
- `2` teaspoons prepared mustard

## Directions

- cook the zucchini and onion in `1` tsp butter on low, the goal here is to remove as much moisture from them as possible, so low and slow for about an hour, stirring every 10 minutes
- preheat the oven to 400F with pizza steel on bottom rack
- whisk together the eggs and spices until beaten thorougly
- add the vegetable mixture
- shred the mozzarella over the bowl on a food scale until `228` g has been added
- spread the mustard on the bottom of the prepared pie crust
