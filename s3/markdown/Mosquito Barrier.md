# Mosquito Barrier

## Equipment

- bug fogger or garden sprayer
- 1 gallon container with lid

## Ingredients

- `5` TBSP garlic juice
- `1` gallon water

## Directions

- mix the garlic guice with the water by adding them to the container and shaking the container
- pour the mixture into a garden sprayer or bug fogger
- apply the mixture around the perimieter of your property, or any crops or surfaces you want to keep bugs off of

## Notes

- this STINKS, but the smell wears off after 3 hours or so
- a treatement will last for about 3 weeks, UV light breaks down the garlic
- it keeps more than mosquitos away, any sort of small bug that you don't want, even mammals
- you can spray this directly on your garden crops to prevent rabbits, deer, or bugs from eating them, and since its just garlic juice and water, it will wash off when you wash your produce
- to combine the mixture, use an old milk jug or something so you can easily shake the mixture together
- I use Garlic Barrier 2002 AG+ Liquid Spray on Amazon specifically made for bugs, but you could juice your own garlic
