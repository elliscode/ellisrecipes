# Bangers and Mash
## Ingredients
- 1/2 tbsp oil
- 8 sausages of choice (Note 1)
- 1 large onion , halved and finely sliced (yellow, white or brown) (Note 2)
- 2 garlic cloves , minced
- 3 tbsp flour (plain)
- 2 cups beef stock/broth , low sodium, store bought or homemade (Note 3)
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
### To Serve
- Mashed potato
- Peas
## Instructions
- Cook sausages: Heat oil in a large skillet / fry pan over medium high heat. Add sausages and cook, turning, until browned as much as possible all over and cooked through. Cook time will differ depending on sausage size – mine take around 8 minutes.
- Remove sausages onto a plate. Turn heat down to medium.
- 2 tbsp oil remaining: You need around 2 tbsp oil left in the skillet. If you have much less, add a bit of butter or oil.
- Saute onion and garlic: Add onion and garlic, cook until golden brown – around 4 minutes.
- Cook off flour 2 minutes: Add flour and mix through. Then cook, stirring constantly for 2 minutes.
- Gradually add beef stock: Add about 3/4 cup of beef broth and mix into the onion so it becomes a sludge. Then add remaining beef broth and mix until combined. If it's lumpy, use a whisk to help make it smooth.
- Thicken gravy: Simmer, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes until the gravy thickens but is slightly thinner than you want – it will thicken more as you serve it.
- Season: Add salt and pepper. Stir, taste, then add more salt if you want.
- Serve sausages with plenty of gravy, with mashed potato and peas on the side. (Low carb option – Creamy Cauliflower Mash)
## Recipe Notes:
- Sausages – You can use any sausages you want, classic Bangers and Mash is made with thick pork sausages. I used beef in some of the photos and pork in the video. If you use low fat sausages, they will not drop as much juice and fat when cooking so the gravy will not be as tasty.
- Onion –  I like making onion gravy because it adds flavour, fills out the gravy and makes it so you can smother the sausages in gravy. But it is optional – you can skip it if you want.
- Beef broth/liquid stock – I really like making my gravy with beef rather than chicken broth because it has a more intense flavour and it gives the gravy a nicer deep brown colour. But you can use chicken if you prefer – the gravy will be a lighter colour. If you use homemade beef stock, you’ll really elevate this humble comfort food to another level!
- Nutrition per serving, assuming 4 servings. I use very juicy, fatty pork sausages which accounts for 593 calories of the total shown below, so if you use leaner sausages, the calories per serving will be less!
