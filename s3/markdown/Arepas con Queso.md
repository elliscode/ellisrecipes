# Arepas con Queso
## Ingredients 
- `2` cups masarepa flour
- `2` teaspoons salt
- `2` teaspoons sugar, plus more to taste
- `2` tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
- `1.5` cup mozzarella cheese, freshly shredded
- `1/4` cup whole milk
- `2.5` cups water, lukewarm
- `1` teaspoon nonstick cooking spray, for the skillet
## Instructions 
- In a large mixing bowl, combine the masarepa flour, salt, and sugar. Add the room temperature butter and `1.5` cup of shredded mozzarella cheese. Mix well to incorporate the ingredients evenly.
- Pour `1/4` cup of milk and slowly pour in the lukewarm water while continuously mixing the dough. Knead the dough until it becomes smooth and manageable, adding more water if necessary to achieve the right consistency.
- Let the dough rest for about 5 minutes.
- Divide the dough into `6` equal-sized portions and roll each portion into a ball. Flatten each ball into a disc shape, about 1/4 inch thick.
- Heat a skillet over medium heat and spray with nonstick cooking spray. Place the arepas on the skillet and cook for about 5 minutes on each side, or until they develop a golden brown crust.
- Let them cool for a few minutes before serving.
## Notes
- Avoid using butter when cooking the arepas to prevent burning too quickly. Instead, opt for oil. If you desire the buttery taste, cook the arepas with oil and add a layer of salted butter after they're fully cooked.
- Aim for a dough that's soft but not sticky. If it's too dry, add water tablespoon by tablespoon. If it's too wet, a bit more masarepa can help. Let the dough rest for 5 minutes before shaping.
- For a cheesier arepa con queso, add a tablespoon of cheese at the center of each dough ball before flattening into a patty. Remove any air pockets before cooking!
- Cook the arepas on medium heat to allow the inside to warm and the cheese to melt while developing a golden crust without burning.
