# Beef Shaptak

## Ingredients

- `2` bell peppers
- `2` dried red chiles (i used 6 birds eye chilies)
- `3` tablespoons cooking oil
- `2` fresh green chiles, thinly sliced (serranos)
- `2` large garlic cloves, thinly sliced (added a third small clove)
- `1.5` inch piece of ginger, washed but not peeled, thinly sliced
- `1` red onion, thinly sliced
- `500` g top sirloin steak, sliced into long, thin strips
- `1.5` teaspoons unrefined salt
- `1/2` - `3/4` teaspoon crushed Sichuan peppercorns 
- `1` tablespoon sesame oil
- `1` tablespoon light soy sauce
- `2` scallions, washed and thinly sliced, including green tips

## Directions

- Place the dried chiles on a chopping board and press down on them, just to break them apart a little, then thinly slice them.
- Heat the oil in a large wok over medium-high heat. 
- When it is hot, add both dried and fresh chiles and stir briskly until they darken, 
- then add the garlic and ginger. After a minute, when the garlic and ginger have started to brown, add the onion and keep stir-frying for several minutes, until the onion is golden brown.
- Now add the beef, salt, and Sichuan pepper. 
- Stir-fry for 6-7 minutes to seal the meat. If you find that the juices are not being released from the meat (which can happen with coarser cuts), cover the wok for a minute or so to help things along. (Did about 4-5 min here)
- When the juices have run and been reabsorbed, add the peppers, followed by the sesame oil and soy sauce. Stir everything well, then turn up the heat to high, and stir-fry for about 5 minutes, taking care not to overcook the veg. (Maybe did 4 min here. Use judgement)
- Garnish with the scallions and serve.
