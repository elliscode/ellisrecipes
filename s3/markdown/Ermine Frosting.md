## Instructions

### Thickening Roux:

- Place flour and sugar in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly, for 30 seconds.
- While whisking constantly, slowly pour the milk in.
- As the milk gets hotter, it will start to thicken - stir constantly so the base doesn't catch.
- Cook until the mixture thickens in a thick, dolloping custard - see video for texture. TIP: Thicker texture = thicker frosting texture but won't make the frosting dense, it's still fluffy and spreadable but it just makes it "sturdier" with sharper edges when piped.
- Remove from heat and scrape into a bowl. Cover with cling wrap, pressing down onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming.
- Cool completely. You can leave in fridge overnight but take it out 1 hour prior to using.

### Making The Fluffy Frosting:

- Place butter in a bowl and use either a handheld beater or stand mixer to beat for 3 minutes until it's smooth and changes from yellow to very pale yellow, almost white.
- Now start whipping in the Thickening Roux. On speed 5, start adding the thick roux one heaped TBSP at a time. Take about 1 minute to add it all.
- Once all added, add your flavoring option if applicable, then whip for 2 to 3 minutes until you can see that it is still enough to hold peaks. Then it's ready to use!
