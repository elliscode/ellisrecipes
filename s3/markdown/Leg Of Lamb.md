# Leg Of Lamb

## Ingredients

- `12` cloves of garlic, peeled
- `7` lb / `3.5` kg leg of lamb (Note 1)
- Salt and pepper
- `3` tsp paprika powder
- `3` tsp garlic powder (or sub with onion powder)
- `2` TBSP olive oil
- `2` large onions, quartered (white, brown, yellow, red)
- `10` sprigs of thyme
- `3` sprigs rosemary
- `3` tsp dried oregano
- `3` dried bayleaves (or 5 fresh)
- `1/2` cup / `125` ml lemon juice (`2` - `3` lemons), plus more to taste
- `1.5` cups / `375` ml white wine (or sub with chicken broth/stock, low salt)
- `2` cups / `500` ml chicken broth (liquid chicken stock)

## Instructions

- Preheat oven to 240C/465F (220C fan). (Note 2)
- Use a small knife to make around 25 incisions all over the lamb, with most on the top.
- Cut around 6 cloves into slivers and stuff them into the incisions.
- Sprinkle the lamb generously all over with salt, pepper, paprika and garlic powder. Drizzle with olive oil and rub all over the lamb.
- Place the lamb in a roasting pan and roast for 30 minutes or until it has a nice brown crust.
- Remove from the oven. Turn the oven down to 180C/350F (160C fan).
- Turn the lamb upside down. Pour / place all the remaining ingredients in the pan around the lamb (including remaining garlic cloves). Fill the roasting pan with hot water so it comes up about 1/4 - 1/3 of the way up the height of the lamb.
- Cover with lid or with baking/parchment paper then 2 layers of foil. Bake for 3.5 hours. (Note 3) Top up water if it dries out (e.g. Might happen if your lid is loose)
- Remove the roast from the oven and remove the lid/foil. Turn the lamb over so it is the right side up.
- Cover again and roast for a further 2 1/2 hours, or until you can pull meat apart with forks.
- Remove cover and roast for a further 20 - 30 minutes (to brown). (Note 3)
- Remove from the oven and transfer lamb to serving platter. Cover loosely with foil and rest for 30 - 40 minutes.
- Strain liquid into a clear jug. The fat will rise to the top. Scoop/pour most of it off - I get 3/4 - `1` cup. There should be 2 - `3` cups of Sauce left. Adjust salt, pepper and lemon to taste.
- Serve lamb with the Sauce on the side and Truly Crunchy Roast Potatoes (heat oil while lamb is in the oven, then cook potatoes when the lamb is resting).

## Recipe Notes:

- `1` I used a full leg of lamb which is too long for most roasting trays. If you buy it from a supermarket, typically the shaft (bone) will be cut so it bends so it can fit into the pan. If you purchase it from a butcher, ask them to do this for you because you need the roast to fit flat in a roasting pan so it can lie submerged in the braising liquid.
- `2` Or as high as your oven goes if it can't go this high.
- `3` TOTAL COOK TIME:
- Lamb-Roasting-Time
