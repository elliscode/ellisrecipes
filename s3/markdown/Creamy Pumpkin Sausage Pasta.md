## Ingredients
### For the pasta and sauce
- 1 lb rigatoni
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 1 - 1 1/2 lbs sweet Italian chicken sausage, casings removed
- 1 shallot, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1 15-oz can pumpkin puree
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon red chili flakes
- 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese, plus more for topping
- parsley, chopped, for topping
### For the brown butter walnut sage topping (optional)
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 1 cup walnuts, roughly chopped 
- 3 tablespoons fresh sage, chopped
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
## Instructions
- Cook pasta according to package directions. Reserve 1/2 cup pasta water, then drain the pasta and set aside.
- While the pasta cooks, make the sauce: Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sausage, break it up with a wooden spoon, and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it's just cooked through. Remove the sausage from the pan.
- In the same skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat. Add the shallots and garlic and cook for 2 minutes, stirring often, until the shallots begin to soften.
- Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Stir in the canned pumpkin, heavy cream, salt, pepper, nutmeg, chili flakes, and parmesan cheese. Let simmer for 2 minutes, then turn off the heat.
- To a small skillet over medium-low, add the butter. Cook, whisking often, for about 6-7 minutes until the butter has turned golden brown. Add the chopped walnuts and sage and cook for 5 minutes until toasted. Turn off the heat.
- Add the cooked pasta, cooked sausage, and 1/4 cup pasta water to the pumpkin sauce and stir until well-coated. If needed, add more pasta water until the sauce is creamy and glossy. Taste and add more salt and pepper if desired. 
- Serve pasta in shallow bowls with the crispy walnut sage topping, more parmesan cheese, and a sprinkle of parsely on top. Enjoy!
