# Cream Cheese Frosting

## Ingredients

- `8` ounces (`225` g) cream cheese, at room temperature*
- `8` tablespoons (`113` g) lightly salted or unsalted butter, at room temperature
- `1` cup (`100` g) powdered sugar
- `1/2` teaspoon vanilla extract
- `1/8` teaspoon salt if using unsalted butter
- squeeze of lemon juice, optional

## Directions

- In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or in a large bowl with an electric beater or wooden spoon) combine the cream cheese and butter. Beat on medium-low speed until smooth and combined, 1-2 minutes, scraping the sides of the bowl and paddle as needed.
- Sift the powdered sugar into the cream cheese mixture and add the vanilla and salt. Beat the frosting on low speed to combine, then increase the speed to medium-high and beat until light and fluffy, 1-2 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl once or twice.
- Taste the frosting, adding a squeeze of lemon if you want to sharpen the flavors. Use right away, or store refrigerated airtight for up to 1 week. If chilled, let soften to room temperature before using.
