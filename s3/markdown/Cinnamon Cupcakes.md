# Cinnamon Cupcakes

Servings:

## Ingredients

- `165` g all-purpose flour
- `200` g sugar
- `1.5` tsp baking powder
- `2` tsp ground cinnamon
- `1/2` tsp fine salt
- `120` g milk
- `120` g water
- `56` g vegetable oil
- `1` tsp vanilla extract
- `1` large egg, room temp

## Directions

- Begin by preheating oven to 350F / 175C, and place cupcake liners in baking pans.
- Add `165` g all-purpose flour, `200` g sugar, `1.5` tsp baking powder, `2` tsp cinnamon and `1/2` tsp salt into a large bowl and gently combine with a large spoon or whisk.
- Pour in `120` g of milk and gently stir until just combined. The batter will be thick but that's how it should be!
- Next add `120` g water, `56` g vegetable oil, `1` tsp vanilla extract, and `1` large egg. Whisk together just until the batter comes together.
- Fill the cupcake liners about 2/3 way full (about 58 g of batter each). Bake for 24-26 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.
- Let the cupcakes cool for 10 minutes before moving them to a cooling rack to finish cooling. If you want to accelerate the cooling process, place the pan in the freezer for about 30 minutes.
