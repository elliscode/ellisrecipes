# Mexican Chicken Soup

## Ingredients

For the soup:

- `2` tablespoons olive oil
- `1` medium onion chopped (about 2 cups)
- `3` carrots peeled and chopped (about 1 cup)
- `3` ribs celery chopped (about 1 cup)
- `2` cloves garlic minced
- `6` cups chicken broth
- `1` (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes undrained
- `1` jalapeño pepper seeded and minced
- `1` teaspoon ground cumin
- `1` teaspoon ground coriander
- `3` cups cooked chicken diced or shredded (see note 1)
- `2` tablespoons fresh cilantro chopped, optional (see note 2)
- `1/2` tsp Salt
- freshly ground black pepper

## Directions

- In a large saucepan, heat olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion, carrots, and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables have softened, about 5 minutes.
- Stir in the garlic until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the broth, tomatoes and juice, jalapeño, cumin, and coriander.
- Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Stir in chicken and cilantro (if using). Season to taste (I like `1` teaspoon salt and `1/2` teaspoon pepper). Serve, offering, cheese, sour cream, avocado, and tortilla chips or your favorite toppings.
