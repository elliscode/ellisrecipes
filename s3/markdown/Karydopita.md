# Karydopita

## Ingredients

### For the syrup:
- `2` cups water
- `1.5` cups sugar
- `1` teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
- `1` slice lemon
- `1` cinnamon stick

### For the cake:
- `2.5` cups coarsely crushed walnuts
- `6` large eggs
- `1/2` teaspoon ground cloves
- `1` teaspoon ground cinnamon
- `2` teaspoons baking powder
- `1.25` cups milk
- `2` cups granulated white sugar
- `1` cup vegetable oil
- `2.5` cups all-purpose flour

## Instructions
- Prepare your syrup by combining all of the ingredients in a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil and when the sugar has dissolved, reduce heat to medium.  Allow to cook for approximately 5 minutes and then remove syrup from heat.  Allow to cool.  Note: we donâ€™t like this cake overly syrupy, however, if you do, please feel free to increase the quantities for the syrup above.
- 2 cups water,1 1/2 cups sugar,1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice,1 slice lemon,1 cinnamon stick
- Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
- In a large bowl combine all of the cake ingredients.  The order is not particularly important.  Stir until very well combined with a rubber spatula or large plastic or wooden spoon.  Mix very well until the entire batter is uniform.
- 2 1/2 cups coarsely crushed walnuts,6 large eggs,1/2 teaspoon ground cloves,1 teaspoon ground cinnamon,2 teaspoons baking powder,1 1/4 cups milk,2 cups granulated white sugar,1 cup vegetable oil,2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- Grease your baking pan ( we used a 10 inch round cake pan) with vegetable oil, being sure to cover the bottom and sides.
- Pour in your batter.  Spread it around so that it is evenly distributed.  Bake in center of oven for approximately 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.
- When your cake is done, remove it from the oven and gently poke holes in it, using a skewer or a sharp knife. Pour the cooled syrup all over the cake, about 1/2 cup (125 ml) at a time.  The syrup will be absorbed by the cake.
- Allow your cake to cool and serve it directly from your baking pan.
