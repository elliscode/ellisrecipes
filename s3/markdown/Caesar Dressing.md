# Caesar Dressing
## Ingredients
- `2` small garlic cloves, minced
- `1` teaspoon anchovy paste (see note)
- `2` tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice, from one lemon
- `1` teaspoon Dijon mustard (I like the brand Maille)
- `1` teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- `1` cup mayonnaise, best quality such as Hellmann's Real
- `1/2` cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
- `1/4` teaspoon salt
- `1/4` teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
## Instructions
- In a medium bowl, whisk together the garlic, anchovy paste, lemon juice, Dijon mustard and Worcestershire sauce. Add the mayonnaise, Parmigiano-Reggiano, salt and pepper and whisk until well combined. Taste and adjust to your liking. The dressing will keep well in the fridge for about a week.
