### Topping

## Instructions

### Prepare the Dough Using a stand mixer
- Place the flour, semolina, sugar, salt and yeast in a large mixing bowl. Stir together to combine.
- Add the water, milk and melted butter. Mix together on low speed using the dough hook attachment until the dough is elastic, smooth to the touch and forms a ball around the whisk.
### First Rise
- Drizzle the bowl with olive oil and turn the dough a few times so that it is greased with oil. Cover the bowl with a clean towel and leave it to rise for 90 minutes or until doubled. In the summer it may take less time for the dough to rise than it would in winter.
### Second Rise
- Deflate the dough and turn out onto a worktop lightly dusted with a little flour.
