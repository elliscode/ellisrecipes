# Lemon Pan Sauce

## Ingredients:
- `1` tbsp of butter + `3` tbsp sepearted
- `1` shallot, minced
- `6` garlic cloves, minced
- `1` cup chicken stock
- `1/2` lemon, juiced
- `1` tsp dried parsley
- `1/2` tsp salt

## Directions

- In the same pan you cooked your protein in over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of butter and melt. Add your shallots, season with salt, and using a wooden spatula saute until translucent, around 2 minutes. Add the minced garlic and saute another minute.
- Add the chicken stock and bring it up to a simmer. Scrape up any brown bits on the bottom of the pan with the spatula. Reduce until nappe, thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Season with salt and add a squeeze of lemon juice.
- Reduce the heat to low and add the remainder of the butter in, stirring it in with your wooden spatula. As you incorporate the butter, it should thicken the sauce and become creamy. Taste for seasoning and adjust accordingly.
