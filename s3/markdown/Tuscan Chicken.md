# Tuscan Chicken

## Ingredients

- `1` tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
- `2` boneless skinless chicken breasts split horizontally into 4 pieces total
- `1` teaspoon dried Italian seasoning
- `1` teaspoon salt
- `1/2` teaspoon black pepper
- `2` tablespoons unsalted butter
- `1` small yellow onion diced (about `3/4` cup)
- `1/4` tsp garlic powder
- `1` large tomato diced (about `1.5` cups)
- `3` cups baby spinach
- `1` cup heavy cream
- `1/2` cup freshly grated Parmesan
- Fresh parsley for serving

## Directions

- Heat oil in a large skillet set over medium heat. Add chicken and season with Italian seasoning, salt and pepper. Cook until golden and no longer pink, 8 minutes per side. Remove from the skillet and set aside.
- Reduce heat to medium-low, then add butter and a splash of water, broth or white wine, deglazing the brown bits from the pan. Saute onions for 5 minutes until translucent, then stir in garlic and cook 30 to 60 seconds, until fragrant.
- Add diced tomatoes and spinach, season with salt and pepper and cook until spinach begins to wilt.
- Stir in heavy cream and Parmesan cheese and bring mixture to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and summer until the sauce is slightly reduced, about 3 minutes. Return chicken to skillet and cook until heated through, about 5 to 7 minutes.
- Garnish with parsley and serve immediately with your favorite side dishes.
