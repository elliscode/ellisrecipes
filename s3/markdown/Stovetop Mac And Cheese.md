# Stovetop Mac And Cheese

Note: Please shred your own cheese from a block. If you use pre-shredded cheese, it will not come out good. The reason for this is pre-shredded cheese is coated in either microcrystalline cellulose or powdered starches, which greatly reduces the meltability.

## Ingredients

- `1` lb pasta
- `1` stick butter
- `12` oz evaporated milk
- `1` tsp hot sauce
- `1` tsp salt
- Fresh ground pepper
- `16` oz sharp cheddar, shredded from a block

## Directions

- in a large pasta pot, bring 6 quarts of water to a boil
- heavily salt the water and cook pasta for 6 min
- drain pasta and set aside
- over low heat, add butter to the pasta pot and melt, toss cooked pasta in butter
- add everything else to the pot and stir until cheese is melted
