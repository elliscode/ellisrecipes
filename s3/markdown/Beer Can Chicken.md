# Beer Can Chicken
## Ingredients  
- `1` chicken about 3-4 pounds
- `1` can beer
- `3` tablespoons chicken seasoning
## Instructions 
Remove and discard any giblets inside the chicken.
Open the beer and empty half of the can (into a glass for the chef is fine!)
Combine the spice rub and massage over the chicken. Place the chicken over the beer can, legs down and place in a 9" cast iron skillet.
### To Grill
Preheat grill to medium heat, about 375°F.
Place the cast iron skillet with the beer can and chicken directly the grill. Close the lid and allow to cook until tender and the chicken reaches 165°F in the breast and 180°F in the thigh. (Approximately 50-60 minutes).
Carefully remove from the grill, discard beer can and rest 10 minutes, tented with foil, before carving.
### To Bake
Preheat oven to 375°F.
Place the cast iron skillet with the beer can chicken in the oven. Allow to cook until tender and the chicken reaches 165°F in the breast and 180°F in the thigh. (Approximately 45-60 minutes).
Carefully remove from the oven, discard beer can and rest 10 minutes, tented with foil, before carving.
## Notes
To make my favorite homemade chicken seasoning combine the following:
- `1.5` teaspoons each: basil, paprika, onion powder, rosemary, dry mustard
- `3/4` teaspoon each: ground thyme, black pepper, garlic powder
- `1/2` teaspoon salt or to taste
