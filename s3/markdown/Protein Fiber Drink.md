# Protein Fiber Drink

## Ingredients

### Dry powder mix

- `9` g psyllium husk powder
- `9` g creatine
- `27` g Naked Whey, Chocolate flavor
- `10` g powdered sugar

### Drink

- `55` g dry powder mix (from previous step)
- `10` fl. oz any liquid (water, milk, coffee, etc.)

## Directions

- mix the dry ingredients together
- add the liquid and the dry ingredients to a nutri bullet cup or whatever blender you use
- blend for 60 seconds to ensure there are no clumps

## Notes

- don't shake this together using a "blender ball" or whatever, the only thing that will remove clumps is an actual blender, I use a nutribullet
- you can make multiple servings of the dry ingredients and store in an airtight container, a 32 oz mason jar fits 7 servings comfortably, then just scoop out 55g of powder into your blender cup
- milk, coffee, or water are the liquids I used, but you could use any liquid you want to
- one serving of the dry ingredients (55g) contains 183 kcal, 2.1g fat, 23.7g carbohydrates, and 17.8g dietary protein according to Cronometer
