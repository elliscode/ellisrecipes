# Marinated Chicken

## Ingredients

- `1/2` cup (`114` g) extra virgin olive oil
- `1/2` cup (`134` g) balsamic vinegar or other vinegar
- `1/4` cup (`70` g) soy sauce I use low sodium soy sauce
- `1/4` cup (`80` g) Worcestershire sauce
- `2` TBSP (`30` g) lemon juice
- `3/4` cup (`150` g) brown sugar
- `2` tsp dried rosemary
- `2` TBSP (`30` g) Dijon mustard or Spicy Brown mustard
- `1.5` tsps salt
- `1` tsp ground black pepper
- `1/4` tsp garlic powder
- `6` chicken breasts or `3.5` lb chicken

## Instructions

- Combine all marinade ingredients in a large mixing bowl and whisk together. Remove a half a cup of marinade and reserve for basting the chicken later.
- Place chicken in a large resealable bag and pour marinade over the top. Gently massage chicken breasts and be sure to close bag securely. (If you have less time, consider poking holes in the chicken with a fork to allow the marinade to penetrate quickly.)
- Refrigerate chicken and marinate for at least 30 minutes and up to 24 hours. I find 4 to 6 hours to be perfect.
